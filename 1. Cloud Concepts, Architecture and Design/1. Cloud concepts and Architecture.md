#### A. Cloud concepts
(+) `Cloud Computing` is a paradigm for enabling network access to a shared and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual resources with self-provisioning and administration on-demand.
==> It is important to understand, however, that the term "cloud computing" encompasses a `variety of systems and technologies as well as service and deployment models, and business models`. A number of claims that are sometimes made about cloud computing, e.g., that it "scales," or that it converts capital expenses to operational expenses, are only true for some kinds of cloud systems.

###### A1. Essential Characteristics of the Cloud
(+) `On-demand self-service`: Provision and terminate services using CLI/GUI without human interaction, or asking for service provider to support.
(+) `Broad network access`: Access services over any networks, on any device, using standard protocols and methods
(+) `Resource pooling`: Economies of scale, cheaper services.
(+) `Rapid elasticity`: Scale up and down automatically in response to system load
(+) `Measured service`: Usage is measured. Pay for what you consume

###### A2. Cloud Types
The key points in cloud types is where is the `security perimeter` so that we can establish `boundary controller` blocking access.

(+) `On-prem security perimeter:` looks something like this

(+) `On-site Private Cloud`: Refer to a clouds for the use of one customer. Where the equipment is inside org's perimeter, and access is from within this perimeter.
==> So we control all access from within our perimeter and allow some access path.

(+) `Public Cloud`: is where client access cloud services over network either through public network or from within security perimeter.

(+) `Multi Cloud`: is where we use more than 1 public cloud.
(+) `Hybrid Cloud`: is where we use both `Public` and `Private` Cloud. The use of only `Public` Cloud and `On-prem infrastructure` would not count as `Hybrid Cloud`

###### A3. Service Models
The key points in each model is `Who owns the control?`:
(+) `SaaS Architecture and Control`: Cloud Provider has total control over the facility, hardware, OS, middleware and they have `admin control` of the application. Whereas, the consumer only have limited admin control (setting user account) with user level control (change permission of a data piece).

(+) And subsequently for other model, we have different level of controls that we one and the CSP own.

(+) `PaaS Architecture and Control`: is where the CSP has total control over the facility, hardware, OS and they have admin control over the middleware, and we only have limited admin control (which version of language to use) and user level control (where to place code)

(+) `IaaS Architecture and Control`: is where the CSP has total control over the facility, hardware, and they have admin control over the OS (the configuration of the OS version), and we only have limited admin control (which version of OS to use) and user level control (who can start MAC, who can start Linux).

###### A4. Cloud Roles
(+) `Cloud consumer or customer`: The one who purchase, configure, maintain and deliver cloud services (with the particular business outcome) using Cloud Service Provier's services.
(+) `Cloud Client or User`: The one who use `Cloud consumer`'s services.
(+) `Cloud Provider`: The one who provide cloud services to `Cloud consumer`
(+) `Car`
